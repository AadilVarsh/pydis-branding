**Free Comic Book Day**
[Free Comic Book Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Comic_Book_Day) is an annual promotional effort by the North American comic book industry to help bring new readers into independent comic book stores. This event usually takes place on the first Saturday of May every year. But this year (2021), Free Comic Book Day was moved to August 14 from the normal day in May in the hopes that much of the uncertainty and disruption related to COVID-19 will have passed. You can read more about the event on their [official website](https://www.freecomicbookday.com/).
