**Pride**

[LGBTQ+ pride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_pride) is the promotion of the self-affirmation, dignity, equality, visibility, and rights of members of the LGBTQ+ community as a social group. Itâ€™s the predominant outlook that fuels a number of rights movements. In the United States, the event serves as a reminder of the [Stonewall riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots) of 1969.
