**Black History Month**

[Black History Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_History_Month) is an annual celebration of the people and historical events of the African diaspora. Historically, its significance lied in an encouragement of teaching the history of Black Americans in public schools. However, the event's importance and popularity have grown over the years, and BHM is now officially recognised and celebrated world-wide.
